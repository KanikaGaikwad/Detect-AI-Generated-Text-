Exploring the landscape of AI-generated texts reveals their diverse applications in Content Generation, Personalized Marketing, Virtual Assistants, and Creative Writing. However, these advancements come with inherent risks such as the spread of misinformation, perpetuation of biases, accountability challenges, and privacy concerns. To navigate these complexities, our project focuses on developing a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm. This algorithm aims to adeptly differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated texts, providing a robust solution to elevate content authenticity and effectively address associated risks.
